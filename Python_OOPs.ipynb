        "    ```python\n",

        "\n",
        "2.  **Calling Overridden Methods**:\n",

        "-- The **`__del__` method** in Python is a special method, often referred to as a **destructor** or **finalizer**. It is called by the Python garbage collector when an object is about to be destroyed and its memory reclaimed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Significance and Purpose:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary significance of `__del__` is to perform **cleanup activities** or release external resources associated with an object before it is completely removed from memory. This includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Closing Files/Network Connections**: Ensuring that open files, network sockets, or database connections are properly closed.\n",
        "2.  **Releasing Locks**: Releasing any locks acquired by the object.\n",
        "3.  **Resource Management**: Cleaning up any other system resources (e.g., C pointers if using `ctypes` or C extensions) that are not automatically managed by Python's garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **When `__del__` is Called:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike constructors (`__init__`), `__del__` is not guaranteed to be called immediately when an object is no longer referenced. Instead, it is called when the Python garbage collector determines that there are no more references to the object. This means:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Its execution time is **unpredictable**.\n",
        "*   It might **not be called at all** if the program exits before the garbage collector runs on that object (e.g., if the program crashes or exits abruptly).\n",
        "*   The order in which `__del__` methods are called for interdependent objects is **not guaranteed**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class MyResource:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",

        "# Create an object\n",
        "res1 = MyResource(\"File Handle 1\")\n",

        "\n",

        "# Example of removing a reference (though __del__ won't necessarily run immediately)\n",
        "del res1\n",
        "\n",
        "# Output may vary depending on when garbage collection occurs.\n",
        "# You might see:\n",
        "# Resource 'File Handle 1' acquired.\n",
        "# Resource 'Network Socket A' acquired.\n",
        "# Resource 'File Handle 1' released.\n",
        "# Resource 'Network Socket A' released. (This one might appear at program exit)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Caveats and Best Practices:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Avoid if possible**: Due to its unpredictable nature, `__del__` is often discouraged for critical resource management. For most cleanup tasks, Python's `with` statement and context managers (`__enter__` and `__exit__` methods) are preferred as they guarantee timely resource release.\n",
        "*   **Exceptions**: Exceptions raised inside `__del__` are generally ignored by Python, but they can lead to warnings or unhandled exceptions depending on the context.\n",
        "*   **Reference Cycles**: If objects form a reference cycle (e.g., object A refers to B, and B refers to A), and neither is referenced from outside the cycle, the garbage collector might still collect them. However, `__del__` methods on objects involved in reference cycles might not always be called.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, `__del__` provides a hook for object finalization, primarily for managing non-Python resources. However, its use should be carefully considered, and context managers are generally a safer and more reliable alternative for predictable resource cleanup."

A method defined in a superclass (parent class) can be redefined (overridden) in a subclass (child class). When you call this method on an object, Python determines which version of the method to execute based on the object's actual class.\n",

        "```\n",

        "-- The **`__call__` method** in Python is a special method that, when defined in a class, makes instances of that class callable like regular functions. If an object's class has a `__call__` method, then `object(arguments)` is a shorthand for `object.__call__(arguments)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Purpose and Significance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary purpose of `__call__` is to create objects that behave like functions. This can be particularly useful for:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Creating function-like objects (functors)**: Objects that maintain a state across multiple calls, unlike regular functions which typically don't.\n",
        "2.  **Implementing decorators with arguments**: A common pattern for creating decorators that accept parameters.\n",
        "3.  **Representing strategies or policies**: When you want to define a behavior that can be configured or customized through object state.\n",
        "4.  **Simulating closures with state**: An object with `__call__` can store state in its attributes, which is then accessible whenever the object is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How it works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "When you define `__call__` in a class, any instance of that class becomes callable. The arguments passed when calling the instance are directly passed to the `__call__` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's create a simple `Multiplier` class that acts like a function to multiply a given number by a stored factor:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Multiplier:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, factor):\n",
        "        self.factor = factor\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __call__(self, number):\n",
        "        return number * self.factor\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create instances of Multiplier\n",
        "double = Multiplier(2)\n",
        "triple = Multiplier(3)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Call the instances like functions\n",
        "print(f\"Double of 5: {double(5)}\")   # Output: Double of 5: 10\n",
        "print(f\"Triple of 5: {triple(5)}\")  # Output: Triple of 5: 15\n",
        "print(f\"Double of 10: {double(10)}\") # Output: Double of 10: 20\n",
        "\n",
        "# The object 'double' itself is callable\n",
        "print(callable(double)) # Output: True\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, `double` and `triple` are objects, but because their class `Multiplier` defines `__call__`, you can invoke them directly with parentheses, just like functions. This allows them to maintain their `factor` state while performing their multiplication logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, `__call__` provides a powerful way to make objects behave like functions, enabling more flexible and stateful function-like entities in Python."
