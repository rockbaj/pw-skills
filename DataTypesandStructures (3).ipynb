It uses a **hash function** to convert each key into a numerical hash value, which is then mapped to an index in an internal array. This allows efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, usually in **constant time (O(1))** on average.\n",

When a key is added to a dictionary, Python computes its hash value and uses it to determine where the associated value should be stored. When the value is retrieved, the key is hashed again to find the correct index. Because of this mechanism, dictionary keys must be **immutable and hashable** (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).\n",
